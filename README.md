Product Price Comparison
This Python script allows you to compare the prices of two different products from e-commerce websites using web scraping.
It's a basic program designed to help you determine which product offers a better price.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
1.requests
2.BeautifulSoup
Replace the URLs in the code with the URLs of the products you want to compare.
Run the script, and it will fetch the prices of both products and display which one is better in terms of price.
Example
Here's a sample usage of the script comparing two realme phones on Flipkart.
Sample Code python
# Insert your URLs here for the products you want to compare
url1 = "URL_FOR_PRODUCT_1"
url2 = "URL_FOR_PRODUCT_2"

# Rest of your code...
Feel free to customize the URLs and expand the functionality as needed.
Remember to replace "URL_FOR_PRODUCT_1" and "URL_FOR_PRODUCT_2" with the actual URLs of the products you want to compare.
